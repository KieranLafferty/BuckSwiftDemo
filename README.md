Couple things...


1. Generate project using included buck v2017.09.04.01 binary included in project `./buck/bin/buck project //Apps/BuckSwiftDemo:BuckSwiftDemo --ide xcode`
2. Sorry for all of the dependencies I added just wanted to be as thorough as possible
3. The -swift.h file in this project isn't generating my AppDelegate.swift class despite having added @objc may have ommitted a configuration setting.
4. Thank you for taking a look!
